Budget-Constrained Bandits with General Cost and Reward Distributions

A Python library implementing various algorithms for budget-constrained 
multi-armed bandit problems, focusing on scenarios with random, potentially 
correlated, and heavy-tailed cost and reward distributions.

This library is based on the research presented in "Budget-Constrained Bandits 
over General Cost and Reward Distributions" by CaycÄ±, Eryilmaz, and Srikant (AISTATS 2020).

Available Algorithms:
- UCB-B1: For sub-Gaussian cases with known second-order moments
- UCB-B2: For bounded and uncorrelated cost/reward with unknown second-order moments  
- UCB-B2C: For bounded and correlated cost/reward with unknown second-order moments
- UCB-M1: For heavy-tailed cost and reward distributions

Example Usage:
    >>> from cbandits import UCB_B1, GeneralCostRewardEnvironment
    >>> # Set up your bandit problem and run simulations
