# Budget-Constrained Bandits with General Cost and Reward Distributions

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/dimassores/cbandits/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/dimassores/cbandits)

This repository provides implementations and simulation frameworks for various algorithms addressing the budget-constrained multi-armed bandit problem, focusing on scenarios with random, potentially correlated, and heavy-tailed cost and reward distributions. The algorithms are based on the research presented in "Budget-Constrained Bandits over General Cost and Reward Distributions" by CaycÑ–, Eryilmaz, and Srikant (AISTATS 2020).

## Introduction

The multi-armed bandit problem is a classic model for the exploration-exploitation dilemma. This project extends the classical setting to a more general and realistic scenario where each action (arm pull) incurs a random cost and yields a random reward, both of which can be correlated and have heavy-tailed distributions. The objective is to maximize the total expected reward under a finite budget constraint on the total cost.

The repository includes implementations of:
* **UCB-B1**: An algorithm for sub-Gaussian cases with known second-order moments, exploiting cost-reward correlation.
* **UCB-M1**: Designed for heavy-tailed cost and reward distributions, achieving $O(\log B)$ regret with fewer moment assumptions by using median-based estimators.
* **UCB-B2**: For bounded and uncorrelated cost/reward with unknown second-order moments.
* **UCB-B2C**: Handles bounded and correlated cost/reward with unknown second-order moments, learning the correlation via LMMSE estimation.

The implemented algorithms achieve tight problem-dependent regret bounds and are optimal up to a universal constant factor for jointly Gaussian cost and reward pairs. For more details, see the reference paper below.

## Features

* Implementation of UCB-B1, UCB-M1, UCB-B2, and UCB-B2C algorithms.
* Flexible environment simulation for general cost and reward distributions (including correlated and heavy-tailed).
* Modular design for easy extension and testing of new algorithms or environments.
* Utilities for statistical estimation (empirical means, variances, LMMSE, median-based).
* Simulation runner for reproducible experimental results.
* Jupyter notebook template for data analysis and visualization.
